## **Title: Classification of Wine quality with the Taste of Machine Learning Models**
 
**Our Project is based on classifying the wine quality based on its chemical compositions with various classifications and predict the best model for the given dataset. The dataset is from UCI machine learning repository 

that consist of both red and white quality wines.**

### **Project Overview:**
 
This Machine learning paper is about wine quality classification model using a combined dataset of both Red and white wines from UCI machine learning repository where the target variable is ‘Quality’. 

The data used in this dataset is from Portugal Vinho Verde wines. Our aim is to classify Wine quality influenced by its chemical compositions like acidity, alcohol, density, chlorides, PH etc., using machine 

learning techniques. The quality of the wines is scaled from 0 to 10 with 0 being very bad to 10 being very good based on its chemical compositions used in different wines. This quality assessment helps both 

producers prepare, and consumers take good quality of wine. The producers can supply good quality certified wines to the consumer market.

### **Technology Used:**
 
* Python 3.11.7

* VS Code - Juypter Notebook

* scikit-learn for ML models

* matplotlib and seaborn for visualization

* pandas and Numpy for data processing
 
### **Methodology and Approach**
 
**A. Data preprocessing**
 
* Scaling the dataset using standardscalar

* splitting the dataset into training and test set of 80-20% split
 
**B. Classification Models**
 
* Logestic regression

* Decision tree classifier

* Random forest classifier

* gradient Boosting

* Support vector Machine

* K nearest neighbour

* Naive bayes model
 
**C. EValuation metrics**
 
* Accuracy

* Precision

* Recall

* F1 Score
 
**D. Other Metrics and evaluation**
 
* Confusion metrics

* AUC-ROC curve
 
### **Results**
 
**The random forest classifier is teh best model with the accuracy of about 83%.**
 
### **Future Work**
 
* Balancing the data

* Feature engineering and exploring additional

features

* Comprehensive model evaluation with wide range

of evaluation metrics

* Better hyperparameter tuning

* Increase the data diversity

* Analyze other machine learning algorithms like ensemble methods and deep learning models to enhancing accuracy.

* Explore other techniques like regression method with different approach.
